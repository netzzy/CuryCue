# Camera Class

Helper class that maintains a 3D position and orientation for a camera and provides multiple methods for manipulating the camera's position and direction. This class is used for the [viewportCamera](<./Palette-camera.md> "Palette:camera") palette component.   
  
## Instantiators`TDU.Camera()`→`TDU.Camera`: 

> Create a new camera object

## Members`dir`→`tdu.Position`: 

> Get or set the direction of the camera as a vector that points towards the target. Up is considered to be (0,1,0).`pivot`→`tdu.Position`: 

> Get or set the 3D point in space where the camera will pivot around or towards.`position`→`tdu.Position`: 

> Get or set the 3D point in space where the camera is located.

## Methods`blendCamera(targetCamera, blendFactor)`→`tdu.Camera`: 

> Returns a camera that is blended with the given camera using the blendFactor. The camera position is blended using linear interpolation, while the rotation is blended using spherical linear interpolation. 
> 
>   * targetCamera - A second camera that is the blend target.
>   * blendfactor - A blend value between 0 and 1."
>`dolly()`→`None`: 

> Move the camera away or towards the pivot point.`frameBounds()`→`float`: 

> Set the camera to frame the given bounding box. Returns the width of the framed scene that can be used when setting up orthographic projections.`look()`→`None`: 

> Pivot the camera around its position.`move3D()`→`None`: 

> Move the camera using data from a 3D mouse.`pan()`→`None`: 

> Pan the camera in a 2D plane facing the pivot point.`setTransform()`→`None`: 

> Set the camera view matrix.`track()`→`None`: 

> Move the camera up/down in the Y-Axis or left/right.`transform()`→`None`: 

> Get the camera view matrix.`tumble()`→`None`: 

> Rotate the camera around the pivot point.`walk()`→`None`: 

> Move the camera forward/back along in the ZX plane and rotate around its position.
