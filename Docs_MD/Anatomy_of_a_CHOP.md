# Anatomy of a CHOP

##   
  
Inside a CHOP
* A CHOP contains a set of **channels** defined over a **start-end interval**.
  * The channels of a CHOP can represent **motion, MIDI, audio, color maps, rolloff curves** or **lookup tables**.
  * Each channel is one **array of raw samples** , which is simply a list of numbers.
  * Each channel of a CHOP has a **channel name** that can be set by the user.
  * The group of CHOP channels is known as a **clip**.
  * A **CHOP contains a clip plus control parameters, a sample rate, some on/off flags, and a start/end interval**.
  * The CHOP can have any start/end indexes. All channels in a CHOP share the same start-end interval.
  * The interval goes from the start position to the end position.
  * The interval of a CHOP is not restricted to be the length of the animation.
  * Each CHOP has a **sample rate** , used if the CHOP contains time-dependent motion or audio data.
  * Audio has a high sample rates when compared to animated motion.

## 

CHOP Inputs, Parameters and Outputs
* CHOPs have "parameters" used to define the data, plus the data channels, which are input/output from the CHOP as its data stream.
  * The CHOP parameters are usually constant-valued, but can be time-dependent expressions.
  * Each CHOP receives channels at its inputs. When the CHOP cooks, the channels of the inputs are combined. The CHOP outputs the resulting channels to other CHOPs.
  * CHOPs output their data channels as arrays of numbers, not interpolated segments. Some CHOPs retain interpolated segments internally, but all CHOPs always output their data as raw samples.
  * If the CHOP's inputs are not changing and the control parameters are not time-dependent, the CHOP will be non-time-dependent and it will not cook every time the animation frame advances.
  * Some CHOPs have Local Variables:  
$I (the array index within the CHOP), $C (the channel number within the CHOP)
  * Some CHOPs output or use CHOP attributes, such as channels grouped as quaternion rotation channels.

## 

Parts of a CHOP
* Each CHOP has a set of parameters.
  * CHOPs' parameters can be expressed in different units: samples (indexes), frames or seconds. These units are selected by the user in a menu to the right of such parameters.
  * Each CHOP has flags: 
    * **The Graph** flag marks the CHOP to be displayed in the Graph of the CHOP Editor.
    * **The Export **flag causes the CHOP channels to override channels of objects, SOps.
    * **The Lock** flag causes the CHOP can be locked and hand-edited. The Channel Editor is the interactive editor of parameter channels in CHOPs.
    * **The Bypass** flag is a convenient way for a CHOP's effect to be disabled.
  * Each CHOP has an info pop-up menu accessible by middle-mouse clicking on the CHOP. This lists channel names and values, sample rate and interval.
  * Each CHOP has a comment field.

## 

CHOP Networks
* CHOPs are arranged in OP networks in components, where CHOP outputs are connected to the inputs of other CHOPs.

Importing / Exporting CHOP Channels

### 

Object, SOP and COP Channels Imported from CHOPs 

Parameters of SOPs, TOPs and objects (components) are able to get values from CHOP channels with expressions like the following: 
[code] 
     chop(_CHOPchannelpath_)
     chopi(_CHOPchannelpath_ , _index_
    
[/code]

However, exporting is preferred where possible. It is faster and involves less typing. 

### 

CHOPs Exported to Component, SOP and TOP Channels
* CHOP data channels are exported to Components, SOPs, etc. to drive their parameters. CHOPs can be exported to any TouchDesigner parameter.
  * Each CHOP has an Export flag (and an Export Prefix, infrequently used), causing the CHOP to attach its channels to Components, SOPs, TOPs and so on.
  * The Export flag and Export Prefix are used to connect channels of an object or SOP directly to a CHOP. It uses automatic matching of channels names. For example, a CHOP "tx" channel could map to an Geometry Component's tx parameter.
  * When a CHOP exports to an object, SOP or TOP, the latters' channels are said to be overridden. An OP's Override menu lists what is overridden.

## 

Channel Index and Value
* The horizontal axis is called the i-axis or the index-axis.
  * The vertical axis is called the v-axis or the value-axis.
  * An index is a point along the i-axis,denoted by i.
  * A value is a point along the v-axis, denoted by v.
  * A sample is an index-value pair (i,v). i.e. the value of a channel at a certain index.
  * A sample is made of a sample index and a sample value.
  * An interval is an index range, which goes from a start index to an end index.
  * A value range goes from a start value to an end value.
  * The index duration is the end index minus the start index + 1.
  * CHOP data channels are arrays of raw samples, in 32-bit floating point format.
  * Channels in a CHOP may be control (parameter) channels or data channels. CHOPs manupulate the data channels.
  * CHOPs can be evaluated at integer and non-integer indexes.
  * Frame is used when the index corresponds to time.
  * When speaking of animation frames, you can refer to start frame, end frame and frame range.
