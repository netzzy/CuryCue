# Vertex Class

A Vertex describes an instance to a single geometry vertex, contained within a [Prim](<./Prim_Class.md> "Prim Class") object. 

## Members`index`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The vertex position in its [primitive](<./Prim_Class.md> "Prim Class").`owner`→`OP`**(Read Only)** : 

> The [OP](<./OP_Class.md> "OP Class") to which this object belongs.`point`→`td.Point`: 

> Get or set the [point](<./Point_Class.md> "Point Class") to which the vertex refers.`prim`→`td.Prim`**(Read Only)** : 

> The [prim](<./Prim_Class.md> "Prim Class") to which the vertex belongs.

### Attributes

In addition to the above members, all attributes are members as well. 

For example, if the Vertex contains texture coordinates, they may be accessed with:`Vertex.uv`See: [Attribute Class](<./Attribute_Class.md> "Attribute Class") for more information. 

## Methods

No operator specific methods.
