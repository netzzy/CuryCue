# Monitors Class

The Monitors class describes the set of all installed [monitor objects](<./Monitor_Class.md> "Monitor Class"). It can be accessed with the monitors object, found in the automatically imported [td module](<./Td_Module.md> "Td Module"). It operates much like a Python list of monitor objects. 
[code] 
    print(len(monitors))		# number of monitors 
    print(monitors[0])			# first monitor in the list
    for m in monitors:
    	print(m.description)	# print all installed monitors' descriptions
    
[/code]

## Members`primary`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The primary [monitor](<./Monitor_Class.md> "Monitor Class") display.`width`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The width of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.`height`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The height of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.`left`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The leftmost edge of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.`right`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The rightmost edge of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.`top`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The topmost position of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.`bottom`→`int`**(Read Only)** : 

> The bottommost position of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

## Methods`locate(x,y)`→`td.Monitor`: 

> Return the [monitor](<./Monitor_Class.md> "Monitor Class") at the specified mouse coordinates, or None.`refresh()`→`None`: 

> Causes the application to behave as if a monitor device has changed. [Monitors DAT](<./Monitors_DAT.md> "Monitors DAT") and other sources will be updated. This is typically done automatically by the operating system, but in special cases can be triggered manually with this method.
