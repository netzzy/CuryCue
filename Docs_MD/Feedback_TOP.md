# Feedback TOP

##   
  
Summary

The Feedback TOP can be used to create feedback effects in TOPs. It can give fake motion blur by not clearing the color buffer. The Feedback TOP's input image will be passed through whenever Feedback is bypassed (by setting the Bypass Feedback parameter = 1). When feedback is activated (Bypass Feedback parameter = 0) the Feedback TOP will output an image stream sourced from its Target TOP. By selecting a Target TOP downstream in the feedback network, other filter TOPs can be added in between the Feedback TOP and its Target TOP to achive feedback effects. See the example networks below. 

See [OP Snippets](<./OP_Snippets.md> "OP Snippets") for some examples on how to use the Feedback TOP. 

**Note:** This TOP supports 3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays.

## 

Parameters - Feedback Page

Target TOP`top`\- Specifies a TOP for feedback to use as its source when activated. 

Reset`reset`\- Activates feedback when set to 0. Disables feedback when set to 1. When disabled, the Feedback TOP passes thru the image connected to its input. 

Reset Pulse`resetpulse`\- Resets the feedback in a single frame when clicked. 

## 

Parameters - Common Page

Output Resolution`outputresolution`\- ⊞ \- quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data. 
* Use Input`useinput`\- Uses the input's resolution.
* Eighth`eighth`\- Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* Quarter`quarter`\- Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* Half`half`\- Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* 2X`2x`\- Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* 4X`4x`\- Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* 8X`8x`\- Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* Fit Resolution`fit`\- Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
* Limit Resolution`limit`\- The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
* Custom Resolution`custom`\- Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.


Resolution`resolution`\- ⊞ \- Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions. 
* W`resolutionw`-
* H`resolutionh`-


Resolution Menu`resmenu`\- A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions. 

Use Global Res Multiplier`resmult`\- Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier. 

Output Aspect`outputaspect`\- ⊞ \- Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.) 
* Use Input`useinput`\- Uses the input's aspect ratio.
* Resolution`resolution`\- Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
* Custom Aspect`custom`\- Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.


Aspect`aspect`\- ⊞ \- Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect. 
* Aspect1`aspect1`-
* Aspect2`aspect2`-


Aspect Menu`armenu`\- A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios. 

Input Smoothness`inputfiltertype`\- ⊞ \- This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP. 
* Nearest Pixel`nearest`\- Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
* Interpolate Pixels`linear`\- Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
* Mipmap Pixels`mipmap`\- Uses [ mipmap](<./Mipmapping.md> "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.


Fill Viewer`fillmode`\- ⊞ \- Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. 

**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing. 
* Use Input`useinput`\- Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
* Fill`fill`\- Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
* Fit Horizontal`width`\- Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
* Fit Vertical`height`\- Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
* Fit Best`best`\- Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
* Fit Outside`outside`\- Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
* Native Resolution`nativeres`\- Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.


Viewer Smoothness`filtertype`\- ⊞ \- This controls pixel filtering in the viewers. 
* Nearest Pixel`nearest`\- Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
* Interpolate Pixels`linear`\- Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
* Mipmap Pixels`mipmap`\- Uses [ mipmap](<./Mipmapping.md> "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.


Passes`npasses`\- Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass. 

Channel Mask`chanmask`\- Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default. 

Pixel Format`format`\- ⊞ \- Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to [Pixel Formats](<./Pixel_Formats.md> "Pixel Formats") for more information. 
* Use Input`useinput`\- Uses the input's pixel format.
* 8-bit fixed (RGBA)`rgba8fixed`\- Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel.
* sRGB 8-bit fixed (RGBA)`srgba8fixed`\- Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace.
* 16-bit float (RGBA)`rgba16float`\- Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel.
* 32-bit float (RGBA)`rgba32float`\- Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels.
* 10-bit RGB, 2-bit Alpha, fixed (RGBA)`rgb10a2fixed`\- Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel.
* 16-bit fixed (RGBA)`rgba16fixed`\- Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel.
* 11-bit float (RGB), Positive Values Only`rgba11float`\- A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue Channel, 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite).
* 16-bit float (RGB)`rgb16float`-
* 32-bit float (RGB)`rgb32float`-
* 8-bit fixed (Mono)`mono8fixed`\- Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel.
* 16-bit fixed (Mono)`mono16fixed`\- Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel.
